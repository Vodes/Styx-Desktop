# Overall explanation
### O(pen)GL and V(ulkan)
Just choose whatever works (or if both work, use vulkan, which usually performs better)

# Profiles
### No Filtering
Use this if you use Styx on a weak laptop/pc (without a dedicated GPU)

### Deband
Use this if you game while watching a video, so that your GPU doesnt do a fuckton of filtering

### Upscale / Upscale Medium / Upscale Heavy
Use this if you watch Anime on your 4k Display or whatever

This wont magically improve the Quality. It'll just look a little better
